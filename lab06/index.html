                <p>I think the first 5 seasons of the flash were amazing expecially when the reverse-flash got involved but anything after season 5 was just a let down. I don't think the show was meant to last that long and because fans kept asking for more after season 5 the writers started just doing whatever, I think thats the reason the show went of the rails. My favorite episode are the ones when he had crossovers with CW ARROW, CW SUPERGIRL, CW LEGENDS, and CW BATWOMAN.</p>
